Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, employing neural network techniques with extensive parameters for advanced language processing.
This article explores the evolution, architecture, applications, and challenges of LLMs, focusing on their impact in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
What are Large Language Models(LLMs)?
A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that applies neural network techniques with lots of parameters to process and understand human languages or text using self-supervised learning techniques. Tasks like text generation, machine translation, summary writing, image generation from texts, machine coding, chat-bots, or Conversational AI are applications of the Large Languag.e Model. Examples of such LLM models are Chat GPT by open AI, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google, etc.
There are many techniques that were tried to perform natural language-related tasks but the LLM is purely based on the deep learning methodologies. LLM (Large language model) models are highly efficient in capturing the complex entity relationships in the text at hand and can generate the text using the semantic and syntactic of that particular language in which we wish to do so.

LLM Models
If we talk about the size of the advancements in the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model only then:
•	GPT-1 which was released in 2018 contains 117 million parameters having 985 million words.
•	GPT-2 which was released in 2019 contains 1.5 billion parameters.
•	GPT-3 which was released in 2020 contains 175 billion parameters. Chat GPT is also based on this model as well.
•	GPT-4 model is expected to be released in the year 2023 and it is likely to contain trillions of parameters.
How do Large Language Models work?
Large Language Models (LLMs) operate on the principles of deep learning, leveraging neural network architectures to process and understand human languages. 
These models, are trained on vast datasets using self-supervised learning techniques. The core of their functionality lies in the intricate patterns and relationships they learn from diverse language data during training. LLMs consist of multiple layers, including feedforward layers, embedding layers, and attention layers. They employ attention mechanisms, like self-attention, to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence, allowing the model to capture dependencies and relationships. 
Architecture of LLM
A Large Language Model's (LLM) architecture is determined by a number of factors, like the objective of the specific model design, the available computational resources, and the kind of language processing tasks that are to be carried out by the LLM. The general architecture of LLM consists of many layers such as the feed forward layers, embedding layers, attention layers. A text which is embedded inside is collaborated together to generate predictions.
Important components to influence Large Language Model architecture  - 
•	Model Size and Parameter Count
•	input representations
•	Self-Attention Mechanisms
•	Training Objectives

•	Decoding and Output Generation
Transformer-Based LLM Model Architectures
Transformer-based models, which have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, typically follow a general architecture that includes the following components:
 
1.	Input Embeddings: The input text is tokenized into smaller units, such as words or sub-words, and each token is embedded into a continuous vector representation. This embedding step captures the semantic and syntactic information of the input.
2.	Positional Encoding: Positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the positions of the tokens because transformers do not naturally encode the order of the tokens. This enables the model to process the tokens while taking their sequential order into account.
3.	Encoder: Based on a neural network technique, the encoder analyses the input text and creates a number of hidden states that protect the context and meaning of text data. Multiple encoder layers make up the core of the transformer architecture. Self-attention mechanism and feed-forward neural network are the two fundamental sub-components of each encoder layer.
1.	Self-Attention Mechanism: Self-attention enables the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence by computing attention scores. It allows the model to consider the dependencies and relationships between different tokens in a context-aware manner.
2.	Feed-Forward Neural Network: After the self-attention step, a feed-forward neural network is applied to each token independently. This network includes fully connected layers with non-linear activation functions, allowing the model to capture complex interactions between tokens.
4.	Decoder Layers: In some transformer-based models, a decoder component is included in addition to the encoder. The decoder layers enable autoregressive generation, where the model can generate sequential outputs by attending to the previously generated tokens.
5.	Multi-Head Attention: Transformers often employ multi-head attention, where self-attention is performed simultaneously with different learned attention weights. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships and attend to various parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
6.	Layer Normalization: Layer normalization is applied after each sub-component or layer in the transformer architecture. It helps stabilize the learning process and improves the model's ability to generalize across different inputs.
7.	Output Layers: The output layers of the transformer model can vary depending on the specific task. For example, in language modeling, a linear projection followed by SoftMax activation is commonly used to generate the probability distribution over the next token.
It's important to keep in mind that the actual architecture of transformer-based models can change and be enhanced based on particular research and model creations. To fulfill different tasks and objectives, several models like GPT, BERT, and T5 may integrate more components or modifications.

Challenges in Training of Large Language Models
There has been no doubt in the abilities of the LLMs in the future and this technology is part of most of the AI-powered applications which will be used by multiple users on a daily basis. But there are some drawbacks as well of LLMs.
•	For the successful training of a large language model, millions of dollars are required to set up that big computing power that can train the model utilizing parallel performance.
•	It requires months of training and then humans in the loop for the fine-tuning of models to achieve better performance.
•	Requiring a large amount of text corpus getting can be a challenging task because ChatGPT only is being accused of being trained on the data which has been scraped illegally and building an application for commercial purposes.
•	In the era of global warming and climate change, we cannot forget the carbon footprint of an LLM it is said that training a single AI model from scratch have carbon footprints equal to the carbon footprint of five cars in their whole lifetime which is a really serious concern.
Conclusion
Due to the challenges faced in training LLM transfer learning is promoted heavily to get rid of all of the challenges discussed above. LLM has the capability to bring revolution in the AI-powered application but the advancements in this field seem a bit difficult because just increasing the size of the model may increase its performance but after a particular time a saturation in the performance will come and the challenges to handle these models will be bigger than the performance boost achieved by further increasing the size of the models.
