Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, employing neural network techniques with extensive parameters for advanced language processing.
This article explores the evolution, architecture, applications, and challenges of LLMs, focusing on their impact in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
What are Large Language Models(LLMs)?
A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that applies neural network techniques with lots of parameters to process and understand human languages or text using self-supervised learning techniques. Tasks like text generation, machine translation, summary writing, image generation from texts, machine coding, chat-bots, or Conversational AI are applications of the Large Languag.e Model. Examples of such LLM models are Chat GPT by open AI, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google, etc.
There are many techniques that were tried to perform natural language-related tasks but the LLM is purely based on the deep learning methodologies. LLM (Large language model) models are highly efficient in capturing the complex entity relationships in the text at hand and can generate the text using the semantic and syntactic of that particular language in which we wish to do so.

LLM Models
If we talk about the size of the advancements in the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model only then:
•	GPT-1 which was released in 2018 contains 117 million parameters having 985 million words.
•	GPT-2 which was released in 2019 contains 1.5 billion parameters.
•	GPT-3 which was released in 2020 contains 175 billion parameters. Chat GPT is also based on this model as well.
•	GPT-4 model is expected to be released in the year 2023 and it is likely to contain trillions of parameters.
How do Large Language Models work?
Large Language Models (LLMs) operate on the principles of deep learning, leveraging neural network architectures to process and understand human languages. 
These models, are trained on vast datasets using self-supervised learning techniques. The core of their functionality lies in the intricate patterns and relationships they learn from diverse language data during training. LLMs consist of multiple layers, including feedforward layers, embedding layers, and attention layers. They employ attention mechanisms, like self-attention, to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence, allowing the model to capture dependencies and relationships. 
Architecture of LLM
A Large Language Model's (LLM) architecture is determined by a number of factors, like the objective of the specific model design, the available computational resources, and the kind of language processing tasks that are to be carried out by the LLM. The general architecture of LLM consists of many layers such as the feed forward layers, embedding layers, attention layers. A text which is embedded inside is collaborated together to generate predictions.
